## Introduction

In this project, we explore the applications of deep learning in image analysis. Our goal is to develop models that can accurately classify images into six different categories: buildings, streets, forests, mountains, glaciers, and the sea. Additionally, we investigate the use of convolutional autoencoders for denoising images.

## Image Classification

### CNN Model

To perform image classification, we built our own convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The architecture of the CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers to extract important features from the input images. We also incorporated batch normalization and dropout regularization techniques to enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

### Comparison with ResNet18

To evaluate the performance of our CNN model, we compared it with the widely used ResNet18 model. We trained both models on a labeled dataset of images from the six categories mentioned earlier. We measured the accuracy and other performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our custom CNN model compared to ResNet18.

## Convolutional Autoencoder

### Encoder and Decoder

In addition to image classification, we explored the use of convolutional autoencoders for denoising images. We implemented an encoder-decoder architecture using convolutional layers to learn a compressed representation (latent space) of the input images. The decoder component then reconstructs the denoised image from the learned representation.

### Denoising Images

To evaluate the performance of our convolutional autoencoder, we introduced noise to a set of images and fed them into the autoencoder. The model was trained to reconstruct the original, noise-free images from the noisy inputs. We assessed the quality of the denoised images using various metrics and visually compared the results.
